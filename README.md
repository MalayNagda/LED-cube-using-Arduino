# LED cube using Arduino

This was the first hardware coding project that I did to learn Arduino programming during my undergraduate education. The objective was to understand and use various Arduino APIs, 
develop logic from scratch for different patterns that could potentially be represented with LEDs and hone my programming, logic building, circuit designing and building skills in the process.
The amount of joy I felt at seeing the physical representation of the code in the patterns of the LEDs for the first time is undescribable. 

It was also a hardware project. So, the soldering of the entire circuit and connecting it to Arduino was also done.
